C编程风格规范
<!-- more -->


- identation
  - 使用4个空格（不用tab，因为tab宽度不一致，并且diff工具更易阅读）
- brace
  - if, while左花括号在同一行
  - 函数定义，类定义，在下一行
- 变量名
  - 类名：FooBarCPU
  - 成员：barVariable
  - 局部变量：new_value
- include
  - 先main header file（和cc文件名相同的头文件）
  - 然后按字典顺序（为了容易找到重复include）
- document
  - Doxygen：自动生成文档
    > Doxygen allows users to quickly create documentation for our code by extracting the relavent information from the code and comments. It is able to document all the code structures including **classes, namespaces, files, members, defines**, etc.
  - **javadoc comment**：以两个*开头的C风格注释
    ```
    /**
     * This is the brief description. This is the start of the detailed
     * description. Detailed Description continued.
     */
    ```
  - 例子
    ```c++
    /**
     * @file
     * Contains an example of documentation style.
     */
    
    #include <vector>
    
    /**
     * Adds two numbers together.
     */
    #define DUMMY(a,b) (a+b)
    
    /**
     * A simple class description. This class does really great things in detail.
     *
     * @todo Update to new statistics model.
     */
    class foo
    {
      /** This variable stores blah, which does foo and has invariants x,y,z
             @warning never set this to 0
             @invariant foo
        */
       int myVar;
    
     /**
      * This function does something.
      * @param a The number of times to do it.
      * @param b The thing to do it to.
      * @return The number of times it was done.
      *
      * @sa DUMMY
      */
     int bar(int a, long b);
    
    
     /**
      * A function that does bar.
      * @retval true if there is a problem, false otherwise.
      */
     bool manchu();
    
    };
    ```
- 代码
  - C文件中不该有extern声明，而应该通过包含头文件方式
    > The key here is that we have a single external declaration in the .hh file that the compiler will automatically check for consistency with the .cc file. (This isn’t as important in C++ as it was in C, since linker name mangling will now catch these errors, but it’s still a good idea.)
